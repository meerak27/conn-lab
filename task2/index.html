            <p>Inspiration</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The inspiration behind my game were those trippy Instagram and TikTok loop gifs where you do not know if it ended or it started. Thatâ€™s why I chose a swirly GIF with a type of game that is so easy but gets more complex as it goes which makes you wanna keep trying. The incentive of having the high score there also makes you wanna keep trying to beat it (unless you are not as competitive as me :p).</li>

        <p>This game was created for a midterm assignment for the course Introduction to Interactive Media studied at NYUAD</p>
