#### Creating a Website
___

This was my first experience with both HTML & CSS, so I was pretty intimidated at first. I first thought of what project I could base this on; the first thing that popped into my head was my midterm from the Intro to IM course last semester. I started with a typical h1 tag as my header, followed by an h2 to specify where it's from. Then I included gameplay and a preview of the game. I proceeded to write about my inspiration behind creating the game because that is always what I am most curious about when playing a game or experiencing someone else's project. I then added a link to play the game, followed by the code, in case anyone was interested. This was all in a container to make the website look more organized. Under it, I placed my name and contact information since it's essential always to have a way to contact you on any website in case of any issues or inquiries.

I was surprised by how integrated it could be with GitHub that if I included the name, my website would pop up, which was pretty impressive. I started with a couple of wireframes and kept changing them up to fulfill all the requirements in a way I liked. The main challenge I faced, which I  hope to fix soon, was that I did not know how to move different sections. For some reason, nothing worked for me. I would also like to push my creativity and be able to create a more intricate and professional design.
