#### Critiquing a Connected Application

___

The connected application I have chosen to critique is the google experiment [Sound of The Earth; Chapter 3](https://soundoftheearth.org/). The artist responsible for this artwork is Yuru Suzuki. In addition to having an interactive website, it is also available in a physical form, Developed for the 23rd Triennale International Exhibition in
Milano.

The site offers consumers the opportunity to contribute sounds and become part of a global music project. With this artwork, you will be able to listen to an innovative machine learning composition that links your submitted sound with similar sounds from all over the world. The artwork was created to remind us that listening to one another can bring us together as a community and develop a sense of commonality and connection. 

Upon the first play, I felt chills; it was amazing seeing the location, date, and time each sound was submitted as the globe rotated. I loved listening to how all the sounds were somehow connected through the machine. This definitely works as an artistic piece and successfully conveys the intended message. Let's take a look at the usability. It's very straightforward there is a large red circle where you can record your sound, the AI process the audio, uploads the file, and when it makes sense, you will hear your submitted sound play. 

What doesn't necessarily work is the 'globe' since it doesn't really represent one. Sounds that were submitted from Japan and the United States played as bullet points right next to each other. I would have preferred if it was a more realistic globe because it would be a nod to the artist's intention, which was to connect people from all over the world. It would really give us all a sense of how far we are from each other but how close this system makes it feel. I would also like it if we could single out the sounds. For instance, when you click on a specific bullet point or a sound from the upload log, it independently plays that sound. Then again, the point behind this artwork is bringing people together and isolating them; it would take away from it.

However, this is likely intentional because one thing I loved was the simplicity. It's very accessible, and anyone with any different educational background, age, or community can understand it as it's very simple. The buttons are straightforward, and there aren't many controls. Overall, using this application made me feel connected to others around the globe and successfully achieved the intended task in mind.
